## Overview

BU Rate addresses the lack of detailed course information available to BU students by providing a centralized platform for course reviews, advanced search capabilities, and academic planning tools. Built with modern web technologies, it serves the entire BU student body of 30,000+ students with data on 7,500+ courses.

## Features

### üìù Course Reviews

- **5-category rating system**: Usefulness, difficulty, workload, interest, and teacher
- **Course-specific teacher ratings**: See how professors perform in specific courses, not just overall
- **Teacher performance analysis**: Sort reviews by teacher to get average teacher scores for specific courses
- **Detailed student feedback**: Get the real insights you need for course selection

### üîç Advanced Search & Filtering

- Filter by prerequisites (courses with/without requirements)
- Search by rating categories and thresholds
- Standard academic filters (college, department, course code)
- HUB requirement filtering
- Combine multiple filters for precise results

### üìä User Dashboard & HUB Progress Tracking

- **Personal dashboard** for registered users with academic planning tools
- **Course management**: Add courses to completed or future course lists
- **Dynamic HUB tracking**: Real-time updates to HUB progress based on your course selections
- **Visual progress graphs** for all HUB categories
- Plan your academic path efficiently with semester-by-semester tracking
